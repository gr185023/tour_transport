                	If you do not accept all of these Terms, then you may not use Our Website. In these Terms, "we", "us", "our" or "Fun Tour" 
                	refers to Fun Tour Software Corporation, and "you" or "your" refers to you as the user of Our Website.
                </p>
                <p>THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE 
                	LAWSUIT.
					We may modify these Terms, for any reason at any time, by posting a new version on Our Website; these changes do not affect

                <h6>1. We do not sell Travel Products</h6>
                <p>Our Website is a travel search engine. Fun Tour does not provide, own or control any of the travel services and products that 
                	you can access through Our Website, such as flights, accommodations, rental cars, packages, or travel insurance (the “Travel
                	 Products”). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the “Travel Providers”) either 
                	 directly (e.g. airline) or as an agent (e.g. online travel agency). The Travel Providers are responsible for the Travel 
                	 Products. The Travel Provider’s terms  privacy policies apply to your booking so you must agree to, and understand 
                	 those terms. Further, the terms of the actual travel provider (airline, hotel, tour operator, etc.) apply to your travel, 
                	 so you must also agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction with any Travel Provider accessed through Our 
                	 Website is at your own risk and Fun Tour does not have any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during
                	 your travel.
                </p>
                <p>The display on Our Website of a Travel Product or Travel Provider does not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute a 
                	recommendation by Fun Tour of that Travel Product or Travel Provider, or any sponsorship or approval of Fun Tour by such Travel 
                	Provider, or any affiliation between such Travel Provider and Fun Tour.
                </p>
                <p>Fun Tour hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Providers. Fun Tour is in no way responsible 
                	for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content. Since Fun Tour has no control over the Travel Products and does 
                	not verify the content uploaded by the Travel Providers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on 
                	Our Website. Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g. payment fees, services charges, checked-in luggage fees,
                	 local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you expected. 
                	 More details here. Some Travel Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you for the 
                	 display of the search results. Our currency conversion is for information purposes only and should not be relied upon as 
                	 accurate and real time; actual rates may vary and your payment provider (e.g. your credit card company) may charge 
                	 conversion fees and apply another date’s currency rate.
