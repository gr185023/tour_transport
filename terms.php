                <h6>1. We do not sell Travel Products</h6>
                <p>Our Website is a travel search engine. Fun Tour does not provide, own or control any of the travel services and products that 
                	you can access through Our Website, such as rental cars, packages, or travel insurance (the “Travel
                	 Products”). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the “Travel Providers”) either 
                	 directly (e.g. tour operator) or as an agent (e.g. online travel agency). The Travel Providers are responsible for the Travel 
                	 Products. The Travel Provider’s terms  privacy policies apply to your booking so you must agree to, and understand 
                	 those terms. Further, the terms of the actual travel provider (tour operator, etc.) apply to your travel, 
                	 so you must also agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction with any Travel Provider accessed through Our 
                	 Website is at your own risk and Fun Tour does not have any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during
                	 your travel.
                </p>
                <p>The display on Our Website of a Travel Product or Travel Provider does not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute a 
                	recommendation by Fun Tour of that Travel Product or Travel Provider, or any sponsorship or approval of Fun Tour by such Travel 
                	Provider, or any affiliation between such Travel Provider and Fun Tour.
                </p>
                <p>Fun Tour hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Providers. Prices change constantly 
                    so you should always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you expected. 
                	 More details here. Some Travel Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you for the 
                	 display of the search results. Our currency conversion is for information purposes only and should not be relied upon as 
                	 accurate and real time; actual rates may vary and your payment provider (e.g. your credit card company) may charge 
                	 conversion fees and apply another date’s currency rate.
                </p>

                    PROPERTY RIGHT.  CLAIMS INCLUDE CLAIMS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING INTENTIONAL TORT), FRAUD, AGENCY,

                <p>If You intend to seek arbitration You must first send to the Company, by certified mail, a written Notice of 
                    Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Company must be sent to legal@funtour.ph. The Notice shall describe the nature 
                    and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought. If you and we cannot reach an agreement to 
                    resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence arbitration. 
                    All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration rules of the 
                    Philippine Arbitration Association. The arbitrator’s award is binding and may be entered in any court of 
                    competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration brought under, or 
                    with respect to, Claims is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms 
                    whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless Company and You agree otherwise, the 
                    arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form 
                    of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.
                </p>
                <p>For arbitration claims you assert against Company in accordance with this section (but not for any arbitration 
                    claim against you) Company will pay all of your administrative, hearing, and arbitrator’s fees and costs for 
                    the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers, experts, or witnesses) in excess of 
                    any filing fee you would have been required to pay to file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court 
                    (whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside. Unless unlawful, Company will pay its, 
                    and you will pay your, lawyers’, experts’, and witness fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims. 
                    The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and 
                    only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Similarly, an 
                    arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any 
                    other case except to enforce the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the 
                    arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all 
                    parties.
                </p>
                <p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WILL NOT AGREE TO ACT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR

                    from your use of them. You should refer to the separate terms of use, privacy policies, and other rules posted 
                    on Other Websites before you use them. You agree not to create a link from any website, including any website 
                    controlled by you, to Our Website.

                <h6>12. General Requirements</h6>
                <p>We may change the site and these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion and without notice to You. You are 
                    responsible for remaining knowledgeable about these Terms. Your continued use of the site constitutes your 
                    acceptance of any changes to these Terms and any changes will supersede all previous versions of the Terms. 
                    Unless otherwise specified herein, all changes to these Terms apply to all users, including those enrolled 
                    before the date the changes take effect. Further, we may terminate this agreement with you under these Terms 
                    at any time. Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or 
                    representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. You may not 
                    assign, delegate or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms. We may assign our rights and duties 
                    under these Terms without such assignment being considered a change to the Terms and without notice to you, 
                    provided your rights under these Terms are not prejudiced. One or more patents may apply to this site and to 
                    the features and services accessible via the site. If we fail to act with respect to your breach or anyone 
                    else's breach on any occasion, we are not waiving our right to act with respect to future or similar breaches. 
                    If a court finds any of these Terms to be unenforceable or invalid, that Term will be enforced to the fullest 
                    extent permitted by applicable law and the other Terms will remain valid and enforceable. These Terms, together 
                    with those agreements made a part of these Terms by reference, make up the entire agreement between us relating 
                    to your use of Our Website, including Bookings, and replace any prior understandings or agreements (whether oral 
                    or written) regarding your use of Our Website. To the extent permitted by law, the laws of the Philippines, 
                    without regard to its conflict of laws rules, will govern these Terms, as well as your and our observance of 
                    them. If you take any legal action relating to your use of Our Website, including Bookings, or these Terms, 
                    or our services, you agree to file such action only in the courts located in Cebu, Philippines; if you are a 
                    consumer, the law may allow you to bring proceedings also in the courts for the place where you are domiciled. 
                    In any such action or any action we may initiate, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover all legal 
                    expenses incurred in connection with the action, including but not limited to costs, both taxable and non-
                    taxable, and reasonable attorney fees. To the extent permitted by law, you agree that any disputes, claims 
                    and causes of action arising out of or connected with Our Website and/or these Terms, will be resolved 
                    individually, without resort to any form of class action.
